# AI Pygame Visualiser

## ðŸš€ Overview

**AI Pygame Visualiser** is a Python project that uses **Pygame** to visualize AI or algorithmic behavior in a graphical window.  
The goal is to provide an interactive, visual way to see how AI agents or algorithms (for example, path-finding, neural nets, genetic algorithms, etc.) behave in real time or through simulation.

## âœ¨ Features

- Visual representation of AI or algorithms via Pygame  
- Configurable environment: you can see agents moving / interacting visually  
- Easy to modify or extend: you can plug in your own algorithm code  
- Lightweight and built in Python (no heavy dependencies other than Pygame)
